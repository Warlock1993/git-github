(Transfered from one pit to the other 100bbls to confirm the stroke counter and pit levelizer are working as designed. This was done at the start of the new well. For the company man.) 2. Confirm the correct operation and accuracy of the Mud Pump pressure monitoring system. Check the operation and calibration date of the mud pump pressure gauges at the mud pump mud manifold and drillers console.( The system has multiple guages that read very close to the same. Only a small discrepency. The ET's keep the guages calibrated and the Fiscal checks each well.) 3. Confirm that the Standpipe manifold has been pressure tested as per the requirements of the well control handbook. (The stand pipe is pressure tested every new well and every 21 days of possible. Good test. There is also a PM for this job. Test charts are inserted into that job.) 4. Confirm the availability and test capability of the HP mud system to supply mud. (The charging pumps supply the mud from the active pits to the pumps at a pressure of 3 Bar. All gauges are checked and certified by Shimmer) 5. Confirm that the pulsation damper has been precharged using nitrogen in accordance with OEM recommendations.( Each pump is set @ 1900psi. But this is changed according to the pump pressure required for drilling. All has tested good by Shimmer.) 6. If equipped make sure barring disconnect switch prevents mud pump from starting.

2018-03-27 08:35:08, ID RUN was successfully completed (refer to attached procedure). A backup of the original Parameters and new Paramters (after ID RUN) were uploaded. Software Library will be updated. NOTE 1: As per the Drive Manual prior to performing the ID Run the motor parameters need to be updated to reflect the data on the nameplate of the motor. Despite the fact the motor was changed out with the same type/model some motor characteristics are slightly different (i.e. motor current nominal speed frequency KW). As per feedback from ABB the original motor data needs to be maintained in the drive parameters. These parameters have been optimized for the running of the mudpumps. Since the mudpumps are also part of a 2 motor setup this parameters should be identical to ensure correct load sharing between the motors. NOTE 2: As per feedback from ABB also the following needs to be done prior to following ABB's procedure on performing a Mud Pump Motor ID RUN: Remove CH0 fiber from the RDCO board to ensure external control system is unable to overwrite any parameters during the ID RUN process. Verify Parameter 20.17 P MOT LIMIT is set to 100%. If not change this value to 100%. Please note that this value will be automatically overwritten when CH0 is reconnected at the RDCO board.

2017-10-01 09:14:25, The mechanics had informed about abnormal noise from the mud pump #1 A end .Initially it looked like some vibrating frame but then figured out it is the noise from the drive end of the bearing of motor #1 A. Confirmed this by using stethoscope and temperature gun. Knocking sound was present at the drive end and temperature of the drive end was around 62 degrees Celsius the NDE the temperatures were OK around 38 degrees.

2019-01-12 05:14:42, We had a call from Mud Engineer that Barite Surge Tank Motor tripped Big Bag Hopper and Slack Slitter found an ALARM Code 7 and WARNING DC LINK Over Voltage and cannot reset the tripped VFD. The Equipment is just on STANDBy Mode and not running but the VFD's are tripped. Troubleshoot and found out that the Drilling 440V SWBD B having an earth fault of O ohms on the indicator an this causes all Mud Additive VFD's to tripped on DC LINK Overvoltage. and further troubleshooting when given the time by the Drill Floor to check which equipment is having an Earth Fault and it was found on MUD PUMP 4 Blower Motor B which is short to ground. Asked Senior Toolpusher an Unplanned Job and open Isolation isolated Mud Pump #4 and Blowers and found one phase wiring on the Blower Motor B is rubbing on the terminal box cover and this cause short to ground. Rectify the damage insulation by using heat shrink and dressed the wiring using cable ties so that it will not rub on any of the terminal box surface. Meggered Motor Winding resistance to ground and IR: 550Mohms Deisolated and test run Blower Motor B and no more earth fault and also Mud Additive equipment are cleared from any fault and alarms.

These motors are purged anf have a EX rating name plate visable. 2. While AC Motor is running in normal operating conditions examine Motor for excessive temperature using an infrared thermometer or infrared camera at both NonDrive End (NDE) and Drive End (DE) bearings. We have done several checks on these pump motors in the recient past. The bearings seem to be in good conditio they have been somewhat overgreased in my opion. 3. Visually examine AC Motor junction box cover and make sure that all fasteners are in place. The cable J box cover bolts are ok when we pilled the covers we sdidn't have an issue with bolts stripping etc. 4. Clean the exterior of AC Motor. The exterior if the motors is clean. No build up of mud of others to impead the heat transfer or induce corrosion. 5. Make sure that AC Motor foundation fasteners are secure. The bolts are fine. 6. Make sure that the supply cable circuit ID marker is in place. Cables are fine. 7. Make sure that there is no damage to earth bonds. Earth cables are fine. 8. Make sure that the ground cable is bolted securely to Motor and equipment mounting surface. 9. Measure AC Motor earth bonding at 0.1 ohms or less. The motors are well bonded to ship ground. 10. Make sure that the ground connection is in good condition and free from corrosion. If required replace ground conductor as per RMS Procedure BPRGENERIC030 (Earth Bonding Conductors Installation Procedure) There fine. 11.

NOTE: Below Task is to be performed with the assistance of mechanical/engineering department. NOTE: Up to 33°C maximum 50% glycol can be used (minimum 50% water) or up to 36°C maximum 20% glycol can be used (minimum 80% water) as per RMS Bulletin # TO16052 (Cooling Water Temperature GEB22 TEWAC Drawworks Motors eDocs# HQSOPSTIBMTR011) These motors are cooled from the ship fw water cooling loops that the Engineers test the water. 14. Check the temperature and glycol percentage of cooling water. NOTE: Task 15 to Task 19 is applicable ONLY to nonclosed loop cooling systems. 15. Remove inspection covers. 16. Visually examine the interior of Motor for conditions listed below: dirt debris water Ingress damage 17. Visually examine the interior of junction box for conditions listed below: dirt debris water Ingress damage 18. Visually examine exterior covers and make sure that the seals/gaskets are intact. NOTE: For below Task use a maximum of 30 psi (2 bar) air and all Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) as required by Transocean Policy Manual (HS&E). 19. Blow dirt and dust from the inside of AC Motor using clean dry compressed air. See pictures attached of the motor interior. 20. Visually examine seals/gaskets or covers for missing parts and damage and replace if required. gaskets are fine. 21. Make sure that the motor heater is working properly using an ammeter. 22. Make sure that all mounting bolts are tight. Bolts are fine 23. Make sure that the torque values on motor hold down bolts are correct. Refer to RMS Bulletin # TO12286 (Loosing Off Of The Motor Mounting Bolts eDocs # HQSOPSTIBDWKS009). 24. Visually examine mount for conditions listed below: cracks in mounting plate We don't see any cracks present. damage to rubber vibration grommets 25. Physically examine speed encoder coupling mounting. The encoders and dog bone strut seem to be ok and well aligned as they somply ride on the NDE shaft stub shaft. 26. Visually examine speed encoder spring and speed encoder adjustment bolt. Signs of misalignment Tightness Damage 27. Make sure that all tools and equipment are removed. 28. Make sure that the air pressure switch is operating properly. 29. Make sure that all Estops associated with AC Motor are working properly. NOTE: Perform Task 30 to Task 32 ONLY on nonsealed bearing Motors. NOTE: Refer to RMS Procedure BPRGENERIC011 (Lubrication Using HandOperated Grease Gun) RMS Procedure BPRMTRN001 (AC Motor Over 500 HP Lubrication) and OEM manual for lubrication requirements and recommendations before performing Task 30 and Task 31. NOTE: Perform below Task ONLY if relief plug is installed. 30. Remove relief plug from bearings. 31. Lubricate AC Motor as per OEM recommendation. These motors have been overgreased they have plenty grease. 32. Make sure that the relief plug is installed after lubrication. The motors are megging very low to ground like less than 500 Kohm very low resistance to earth. We tried several tricks to dry the motors out heat them up to above 45deg.c then meg test no notable improvements to the IR readings. We removed the leads to the VFD the same low IR readings.

IMPORTANT: THE MOTORS MUST BE INSTALLED AT THE SAME POSITION ORIGINALLY WHEN RETURN FROM OVERHAUL THEY HAVE DIFFERENCES MAINLY IN THE BUS BAR CONNECTION STUDS. ALSO AS REFERENCE HAVE A LOOK AT SERIAL NUMBER TO FIT THE CORRECT MOTOR. After all main disconection have been made we moved the main cable away to allow mechanics to unbolt motor foundation. Got assistance from welder to cut some support out to allow motor come out freely. All support that came out is laid down next to each pump properly marked to make easier when assembled back in place (welder required). The motors were rigged up and sent to town for overhaul. See quote in attachment and expected day to come back on board. Additional notes: 1) We used for lifting the swivels lifting eyes of 7/8. 2) The bolts for main motor connection were not all in good shape one or two had to be cut off so new bolts are coming for repleshiment.

2018-06-26 20:17:44, Info from OER: Mud pump motor B failed on mud pump 4 whilst drilling 171/2 hole. Mud pump was shut down and operations resumed with remaining 3 mud pumps. This event was the direct cause of improper lubrication to the mud pump motor. This can also be attributed to not following PM procedures not following PMSR procedures and also having inadequate reactivation procedures. Mud pump 4 shut down and drilling operations resumed. TOFS and MOC conducted. Mud pump isolated and swapped out with spare motor stored on the rig. Other mud pumps bearings evaluated with temperature gun and thermal imaging to verify no hot spots were present. Crews made aware of lubrication procedures for different motors and all motors greased as per these procedures. Upon initial investigation it was noticed that the shaft of B motor had shifted from its normal operating position and moved inboard contacting the shaft of the A motor. After removing the B motor and placing on the deck it was evident that the bearing was missing half the ball bearings and any noticeable signs of grease. Upon further investigation it was found that the rig has interchangeable motors from different vendors some being supplied with sealed lifetime bearings others without sealed bearing and needing periodic greasing. This led to confusion during PM's and lubricating tasks being labeled as N/A for this motor. It was also discovered that during the warm stacking period of the rig NOV and TOI stacking procedures were not performed. Upon reactivation of the rig both NOV and TOI procedures were followed but neither of the two covered the motors on the mud pumps only the pump itself. Lessons learned passed on to reactivation team.----------,229,2290029124979,Corrective,HPMS,MTR,info from oer mud pump motor b failed on mud pump whilst drilling hole mud pump was shut down and

2017-07-24 05:17:17, Main drive motor for mud pump #3 went to high temp alarm due to the blower was not running. The alarm in cyberbase is Mud Pump blower #3 stopped and is a low priority alarm. The pressure switch has a sticker that states Factory set for 8 in WC. Tested the switch and it opened on fall at 10.2 in WC. It was noted in previous trouble shooting by the day crew that Blower B has less air pressure than Blower A. Set the pressure switch to 8.1 in WC. If the pressure switch opens briefly because the pressure it is set so close to set point the blower will shut down immediatly and not restart unless you deassign and reassign the mud pump.

It came back up and ran for about 5 minutes and went back into alarm. Same thing this time also. Bucket was not showing an overcurrent fault or nothing. It was just off. We then shut down the pump and adjusted the pressure switch. We ran it in local with no issues. We then had the driller start the pump back up and it ran fine with no issues.

2019-01-31 10:24:19, Created this job under Mike Moore's login by accident. Night crew noticed that Mud Pump 3A blower motor had a little more vibration than the others. We removed motor to inspect impeller and bearings and didn't find any issues. There was an appearance of a slight wobble when the impeller was spun but we believe this is from the impeller being made of plate steel and welded. Also noticed that the impeller was balanced by removing material from the face of the impeller with a grinder makine the flages thinner in some places that others. We removed the fan shroud and inspected the motor fan also. We DID find that the mounting bolts that attach the motor to the mounting bracket were loose. Tightened bolts reinstalled and tested. Vibration was significantly reduced and we then compared blower 3A and 3B by running them by themselves from the MCC. The two are now very similar. Current draw for both were 10.3 A and minimal vibration can be noticed from both. We believe that this from the welded impeller vs. a machined part.

While drilling 16-1/2"" OH at 1050gpm with 14.1ppg SBM (& boosting at 350gpm = 1400gpm total) we encountered the suction charge pressure on the hex pumps slowly reducing from ~65psi down to ~15psi and triggering the pump to shut down once the charge pressure dropped below the threshold of 20-15 psi (as per design of the hex pumps). Within the last week, we had displaced the riser from 12.4ppg to SW (tropical storm), went back to mud and have weighted up to 14.1ppg. We had cleaned all the suction strainers on 10-21-19 (minimum in them) after displacing back to mud and seeing similar trends. We will continue to monitor charge pressure and take appropriate actions to minimize downtime, by precautionarily checking suction strainers when operations allow. We cleaned suction strainers (finding minimum material in same), added mud to active system to increase hydrostatic pressure on suction lines, swapped from port side active pits (normal line up) to starboard side active pits, checked for unusual barite fill in pump suction lines, checked milliamps on suction pressure transducers, tried multiple pump line ups / configurations including all pumps running at moderate speed to minimum pumps running at high speed.",5.1 - Hyd/Pnuem - Blockage/plugged ,Hydraulic_Failure,3.0,Control_System_Failure,5,Mechanical_Failure,1,Control_system,Mechanical_failure,Mechanical_failure,multiples,Control_system,Hydraulic_failure

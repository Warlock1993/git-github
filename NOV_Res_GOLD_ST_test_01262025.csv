33,"Drilling operations suspended while troubleshooting low charge pressure on #3 hex pump (pump #1 down with discharge module, pump #5 down with swab). We had been off bottom circulating with mud pump #2 and #3 while cleaning liner wash system on mud pump #4. After pump #4 back online, we went to go back drilling when mud pump #3 suction charge pressure dropped below threshold and cause pump #3 to shutdown. Picked up off bottom to clean suction strainer on mud pump #3. (Note: The strainers on all pumps had been cleaned within the last day with minimum debris found in them. We had recently started pumping HiVis weighted sweeps and thought it may have picked up something in the suction line to cause the loss of pressure). (Note: When cleaning suction strainer, the vacuum cutting box in the moonpool filled up and had to be pumped out prior to finishing suction strainer - we would usually change out cutting boxes, but the wind speed was more than the crane could operate in ~45 knots/hr) We will continue to monitor charge pressure and take appropriate actions to minimize downtime, by precautionarily checking suction strainers when operations allow. Isolated Hex #3 and cleaned suction strainer (minimum amount of lime in strainer and adjacent line had minimum build up in it). While cleaning #3 strainer, #4 liner wash was seen to be plugging up again (drain tank and blow down lines again), ongoing swab change out on hex #5 simultaneously (Replacing discharge module on Hex #1 suspended while getting pumps #3, #4, #5 back online)",5.1 - Hyd/Pnuem - Blockage/plugged ,Hydraulic_Failure,3.0,Hydraulic_Failure,3,Hydraulic_Failure,3,Hydraulic_failure,Hydraulic_failure,Hydraulic_failure,Hydraulic_failure,Hydraulic_failure,Hydraulic_failure

55,"MP#2 required shut down due to swab failure just as final pumping of SOBM. Next phase of operations was flushing surface lines in preparation for flipping well to a 1.24 sg brine system in preparation for DST operations and while this task was being performed MP2 was being repaired however the time taken to complete the repairs exceeded the surface flushing time. All four MP's required flipping to brine and SOBM would have been left in the suction line had the pump been left offline causing contamination. This event was a very unfortunate occurrence, failure of the swab could not have happen at a worse time. Swab hours 553. Attached is the hour logs for all four MP's and as one can see the hours for Swabs are well in excesses the hours recorded on this particular swab. We run the swabs to failure and normally get well beyond the hours recorded on this failure.

16,"During drilling operations the pump hand observed mud coming from the liner coffin on mud pump 3. Upon investigation it was found that all 6 mounting studs for the liner retention system had parted, allowing the swab and liner system to pull away from the wear plate on the fluid end. Old style liner gasket from NOV was used in this particular pump. Reference HQS-OPS-TIB-016 to ensure the correct type of liner gasket is being used and in the warehouse. Deactivated the RIN for the old style gaskets (RIN 772439) to ensure that the new style Polyurethane gaskets are ordered as per HQS-OPS-TIB-016 . Removed studs and installed new with new nuts.

52,"Mud pump charging pumps 2, 3, and 4 had faults, pumps kicked off while going to the start up of pumps. One item we observed from the DFR playback and subsequent tests with the drill crew is certain operations require the mud pumps to operate at low stroke counts (< 5SPM). The driller has to ""feather"" the throttle wheel to maintain the needed controls during these evolutions. What we see is the SPM indication being cycled from 2-3SPM to 0SPM and vice versa. When this happens the charge pump is trying to start and stop in rapid succession and this is where the trip occurs. We have monitored this condition at the charge pump buckets in MMER2. You can hear the breaker/starter continually opening and closing on the start/stop commands. We have pulled the configuration from the Schneider control units and compared to documented settings. We confirmed all four charging pumps are configured the same. It should be noted the Schneider controllers are not logging any trips or alarms for these events. After extensive monitoring, it has been determined the trips are only occurring from one operator. It will need to be determined what actions are different from the other operators.

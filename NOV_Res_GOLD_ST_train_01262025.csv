Failure related to operation/use or maintenance of the equipment but no further details known  This job is being made for replacing the mud pump #1A blower motor which deteriorating due to heavy vibration.The bolts on the terminal cover had broken twice and the impeller is very rough.There is an old motor and impellor assembly lying in thruster space which was removed due to vibration. The plan is to assemble a blower assembly using spare motor lying in ballast pump room which was order on job number115720.This is a replacement motor offered by Siemens and more details can be found in that job.We also have new impellors on board and this also will be used for assembling it.The motor has been requested on this job.----------, new impller has been recevied ICN # 10023935 from the store and new motor dessembiled the old motor and old imppler from the old frame was in thruster #3 to use the foam sealed between the motor and frame mounting flange and during the assemilation the of the old frame mounting flange has been found cracked all the way from the eadge to the center get an empty frame from thruster #3 and assembild the motor on the frame and installed the imppler to the motor shaft adjusted the impller gap between the imppler and mounting flange to 140 mm (keep in mind the rubber sealed and imppler housing thkness ) as the impller 180 mm and impller housing 200 mm adjusted the imppler in center of the mounting flange secuered and the imppler bolts and tighten all the bolts rigged up all the liftting gears above the mud pump #1 as the plane is only remove the motor frame with the imppler attched to the motor scuerd the the whole frame and motor then undo all the mounting flange bolts and removed the whole motor and motor frame and impller by slided out from the imppler housing then trnasfreed down get the new assemaly readt at the mud pump room and lifted up and slided inside the impller housing secuerd all the bolts and removed all liftting gears the handover to day crew to be connected up and inspect the cleanes between the imppler from the other side of the impller housing .----------, The junction box of the mud pump was repositioned and the power was connected.Function tested it and rattling noise started due to the loose louvers.This was rectified with rubber packings around.There was still abit ofrattlig sound which was from the side plate where lever is connected to rotate the mud pump manually.This was also fixed and now the noise was gone. The vibration level was a bit more than the other one probably because the unit isn't balanced but there is no other spare onboard to fix it as of now.The RLA was 15amps.Test run it for 5 hrs and then put it back in service.Job has now been completed.Plan is to make one assembly of defective motor prepare a complete assembly from what is remaining and send it ot Lifiting for overhaul and balancing.----------, Parts Requested from ICS:",Material,Material_Failure,2.0,Material_Failure,2,Mechanical_Failure,1,Material_failure,Mechanical_failure,Mechanical_failure,Mechanical_failure,Mechanical_failure,Material_failure

Troublesoot and take necessary corrective action to fix the issue of noisy DE bearing on mud pump#1A drive motor Equipment did not perform as intended per designed specification and not due to lack of maintenance  ID RUN was successfully completed (refer to attached procedure). A backup of the original Parameters and new Paramters (after ID RUN) were uploaded. Software Library will be updated. NOTE 1: As per the Drive Manual prior to performing the ID Run the motor parameters need to be updated to reflect the data on the nameplate of the motor. Despite the fact the motor was changed out with the same type/model some motor characteristics are slightly different (i.e. motor current nominal speed frequency KW). As per feedback from ABB the original motor data needs to be maintained in the drive parameters. These parameters have been optimized for the running of the mudpumps. Since the mudpumps are also part of a 2 motor setup this parameters should be identical to ensure correct load sharing between the motors. NOTE 2: As per feedback from ABB also the following needs to be done prior to following ABB's procedure on performing a Mud Pump Motor ID RUN: Remove CH0 fiber from the RDCO board to ensure external control system is unable to overwrite any parameters during the ID RUN process. Verify Parameter 20.17 P MOT LIMIT is set to 100%. If not change this value to 100%. Please note that this value will be automatically overwritten when CH0 is reconnected at the RDCO board. You can also manually change this Parameter back to original value before reconnecting CH0.----------, Reconnected Mud Pump 1A Blower supply cable.

Ongoing job for Motor ID Run.----------, The mechanics had informed about abnormal noise from the mud pump #1 A end .Initially it looked like some vibrating frame but then figured out it is the noise from the drive end of the bearing of motor #1 A. Confirmed this by using stethoscope and temperature gun. Knocking sound was present at the drive end and temperature of the drive end was around 62 degrees Celsius the NDE the temperatures were OK around 38 degrees. Checked the DE & NDE temperatures of motor #1B #2A & #2B.All the DE temperatures were around 48 degrees and NDE was around 38.Pumped in Cyprinia RA grease around 100 shots on DE of motor #1A and noise subsided .At this point the abnormal noise from the bearing can only be heard with a stethoscope. Still there was a knocking noise from the DE bearing of motor#1A .Decided to monitor the noise and temperature every hour but after a while the operation required shutting down the pumps. Seelan had opened up the inspection cover and checked it for any abnormalities .None found and felt the need of more grease .He also pumped grease in it and left it operation just to monitor the temperatures and vibration .The pump doesn't have any load now .The speed was increased and it has been left running and temperature is being monitored .The temperature at the DE is now 58 degrees and NDE is 35 degrees .On motor #1B DE is 45 degrees and NDE IS 35 degrees.----------, Megger New Motor for MP 1A replacement.

Within the last week, we had displaced the riser from 12.4ppg to SW (tropical storm), went back to mud and have weighted up to 14.1ppg.

98,"Mud Pump Power Phaseback at MP Stp Setpoint Breakdown Job Equipment did not perform as intended per designed specification and not due to lack of maintenance  While conducting rounds in the drill shack we were made aware of a mud pump issue. They reported that they had a power phase back on the mud pumps that they believed was a VMS phaseback. The 3 synced mud pumps (1 2 3) were being ramped up together to a higher stroke per minute count and they reached the mud pump standpipe pressure limit setpoint of 4500psi. At this point the system phased back the power to the mud pumps due to it hitting the setpoint. Also at the same time the power phase back alarm came in another alarm came in labelled Main Synce Deactivated Due to Standpipe Pressure Limit Active. The combination of these two alarms caused the mud pumps to cycle back their strokes per minute to lower pressure below the setpoint. However the pressure setpoint they had set for pumps 1 through 3 were the same as the mud standpipe pressure setpoint. After being throttled back they pumped back up to their setpoint which was also the point that deactivates the sync and phases back the power. Note this is NOT a VMS phaseback its internal to the drilling system. At the time this happened the plant was currently at 40% utilization well under the point the mud pumps will be phased back by VMS. Currently the set point adjust for MP3 is still grayed out on the screen. We suspect this is due to the constant cycling of MP sync by the system combined with the low memory availability of the servers. We have been getting memory utilization alarms all day on the various cyberbase servers. We will keep this job open until we have had a chance to reboot the servers clear up memory on ehawk and the chairs and to compare software among all the mud pumps. I suspect that if mud pump 3 was completely shut down and brought back up it would fix the graying out of its setpoint button.----------, There have been no additional problems with this issue.",Electrical,,,Electrical_Failure,4,Control_System_Failure,5,Electrical_failure,Control_system,Material_failure,multiples,Electrical_failure,Electrical_failure

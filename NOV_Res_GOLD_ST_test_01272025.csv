98,"Mud Pump Power Phaseback at MP Stp Setpoint Breakdown Job Equipment did not perform as intended per designed specification and not due to lack of maintenance  While conducting rounds in the drill shack we were made aware of a mud pump issue. They reported that they had a power phase back on the mud pumps that they believed was a VMS phaseback. The 3 synced mud pumps (1 2 3) were being ramped up together to a higher stroke per minute count and they reached the mud pump standpipe pressure limit setpoint of 4500psi. At this point the system phased back the power to the mud pumps due to it hitting the setpoint. Also at the same time the power phase back alarm came in another alarm came in labelled Main Synce Deactivated Due to Standpipe Pressure Limit Active. The combination of these two alarms caused the mud pumps to cycle back their strokes per minute to lower pressure below the setpoint. However the pressure setpoint they had set for pumps 1 through 3 were the same as the mud standpipe pressure setpoint. After being throttled back they pumped back up to their setpoint which was also the point that deactivates the sync and phases back the power. Note this is NOT a VMS phaseback its internal to the drilling system. At the time this happened the plant was currently at 40% utilization well under the point the mud pumps will be phased back by VMS. Currently the set point adjust for MP3 is still grayed out on the screen. We suspect this is due to the constant cycling of MP sync by the system combined with the low memory availability of the servers. We have been getting memory utilization alarms all day on the various cyberbase servers. We will keep this job open until we have had a chance to reboot the servers clear up memory on ehawk and the chairs and to compare software among all the mud pumps. I suspect that if mud pump 3 was completely shut down and brought back up it would fix the graying out of its setpoint button.----------, There have been no additional problems with this issue.",Electrical,,,Electrical_Failure,4,Control_System_Failure,5,Electrical_failure,Control_system,Material_failure,multiples,Electrical_failure,Electrical_failure

Despite the fact the motor was changed out with the same type/model some motor characteristics are slightly different (i.e. motor current nominal speed frequency KW). As per feedback from ABB the original motor data needs to be maintained in the drive parameters. These parameters have been optimized for the running of the mudpumps. Since the mudpumps are also part of a 2 motor setup this parameters should be identical to ensure correct load sharing between the motors. NOTE 2: As per feedback from ABB also the following needs to be done prior to following ABB's procedure on performing a Mud Pump Motor ID RUN: Remove CH0 fiber from the RDCO board to ensure external control system is unable to overwrite any parameters during the ID RUN process. Verify Parameter 20.17 P MOT LIMIT is set to 100%. If not change this value to 100%. Please note that this value will be automatically overwritten when CH0 is reconnected at the RDCO board. You can also manually change this Parameter back to original value before reconnecting CH0.----------, Reconnected Mud Pump 1A Blower supply cable. Deisolated Blower and rotation checked and working properly and no abnormal noise.----------, Continue work on Mud Pump #1A mounted back the Motor Junction Box using chain block line up Terminal box to the motor and installed all bolts space heater connected all motor cables closed all covers drilled holes on Space heater terminal box and Winding RTD's terminal box reconnected all wirings. Ongoing job for Motor ID Run.----------, The mechanics had informed about abnormal noise from the mud pump #1 A end .Initially it looked like some vibrating frame but then figured out it is the noise from the drive end of the bearing of motor #1 A. Confirmed this by using stethoscope and temperature gun. Knocking sound was present at the drive end and temperature of the drive end was around 62 degrees Celsius the NDE the temperatures were OK around 38 degrees. Checked the DE & NDE temperatures of motor #1B #2A & #2B.All the DE temperatures were around 48 degrees and NDE was around 38.Pumped in Cyprinia RA grease around 100 shots on DE of motor #1A and noise subsided .At this point the abnormal noise from the bearing can only be heard with a stethoscope. Still there was a knocking noise from the DE bearing of motor#1A .Decided to monitor the noise and temperature every hour but after a while the operation required shutting down the pumps. Seelan had opened up the inspection cover and checked it for any abnormalities .None found and felt the need of more grease .He also pumped grease in it and left it operation just to monitor the temperatures and vibration .The pump doesn't have any load now .The speed was increased and it has been left running and temperature is being monitored .The temperature at the DE is now 58 degrees and NDE is 35 degrees .On motor #1B DE is 45 degrees and NDE IS 35 degrees.----------, Megger New Motor for MP 1A replacement.

Disconnected Main Motor 1A motor cables in the terminal box and remove all terminal box mounting bolts and used chain block to remove the complete terminal box. Removed all tools. Ongoing jobs Drilling Department and Mechanical Department to remove the Blower Motor 1A and Main Motor 1A.----------, As per the below the mud piump motor has been replaced in light of this I am closing this job out----------, The temperatures of the DE bearing for MP1A was monitored and it has been alwas around 68 degrees.The new motor assembly which was there in the thruster#3 space has now been shifted to the mud pump room.This motor model has the initial ending with BL which was confirmed prior to shifting.The motor was meggered and it is fine.We had a quick look at the tools needed for the job these were some that were required for dismantling it. 1. Spaners/ socket set: 14mm.17 mm.19mm 10mm & 24mm. 2.Chain blocks1 ton & 5 ton. 3.Adjustable for glands and some fittings.Thexact size of the motor mounting bolts arent checked and for this mecahnics or drill crew can help when required.----------, The pump #1 has been running since 8 hrs at full load and the temperature of the DE end was monitored every 2 hrs and it was 64 degrees.This pump was started because drill crew had to clean the stariner of pump#4.When the pump #4 is ready to use this pump will be changed over.NDE is 45 degrees----------, The mud pump was running a few days ago for a long time and the maximum temperature that DE bearing had reached was 72 degrees.This was informed to the toolpusher & electrical supervisor as the other pumps were idle and pump #3 was pumping very slow.At the next available oppurtunity this pump was shut down and changed over.NDE bearings were 45 degrees.",Mechanical,Mechanical_Failure,1.0,Control_System_Failure,5,Mechanical_Failure,1,Control_system,Mechanical_failure,Mechanical_failure,multiples,Mechanical_failure,Mechanical_failure
41,"During a connection the Derrickman reported pre-charge pressure on Mud Pump #1 Discharge Dampener had dropped to 400psi. Pump was taken off line & electrically/mechanically isolated. New Discharge Dampener was fitted 31/08/2019, Unit came from the manufacturer already dressed with Diaphragm pre-installed. After fitting rig crew pressured up diaphragm to recommended pre-charge pressure as per Procedure. The history of the rubber diaphragm is unknown at this time, (i.e. age & how long since it was installed into the Dampener unit) As per comments in Root Cause the event should not have happened, all three of the rigs mud pumps have recently been fitted with New Discharge Dampeners. Pre-charge pressures are & will continue to be checked every tour. With Mud pump fully isolated, the discharge dampener diaphragm was found to be ruptured. A new diaphragm was fitted & pre-charge to the correct operating pressure.",2.7 - Material - Burst,Material_Failure,2.0,Material_Failure,2,Material_Failure,2,Material_failure,Material_failure,Material_failure,Material_failure,Material_failure,Material_failure
12,"While circulating and conditioning mud while the client was making decisions on hole direction, We had swabs starting to leak on mud pump #2 (cylinder #2), then mud pump #3 (cylinder 1-3), mud pump #1 (cylinder 1) and mud pump #4 (cylinders 1-3). Under investigation due to swabs having less than 30 hours on them. Continue to monitor liner wash to determine worn swabs ahead of time NOTE: changed to correct swab type for Oil based mud use. (Patriot) Replaced swabs that were available (3 new swabs available and 8 used swabs available). 4 hours of the time acquired due to waiting on 4 mud pumps to be available. Client has requested mud pump #5 be isolated and used for completions only. We had 3 pumps operational (#1 - #3). The time was to pull swabs on mud pump #4, clean pump & liner wash tank, and replace swabs on mud pump #4 (that we had to wait to get off a crew boat).",1.1 Material - Leakage,Material_Failure,2.0,Material_Failure,2,Material_Failure,2,Material_failure,Material_failure,Material_failure,Material_failure,Material_failure,Material_failure
6,"Suction manifold PRV passing on mud pump #3 Suction PRV has reached the end of its serviceable life. There is no adjustment on this PRV and the spring is no longer strong enough to hold the 70 psi as it should. At the time of the event mud pump #4 was isolated for a similar problem. Downtime caused by the fact we had to stop drilling and circulate until mud pump #4 was de-isolated. Ordered 4 new suction PRV's for the mud pumps on RMS job #2270029176944 De-isolated mud pump #4. Mud pump #3 isolated and removed the suction manifold PRV, mechanic function and pressure tested same with no success. Suction PRV was replaced with an already tested spare. Both suction and discharge filters cleaned. Discharge filter observed to be fairly dirty. Opened the suction and discharge modules and inspected the valves and seats, replaced valve and seat on discharge module #2 - this was not effecting the suction PRV.",2.3 - Material - Wear,Material_Failure,2.0,Hydraulic_Failure,3,Mechanical_Failure,1,Hydraulic_failure,Mechanical_failure,Material_failure,Hydraulic_failure,Hydraulic_failure,Material_failure

8,"Piston rubbers on cylinder #1 and #2 washed out: While drilling the liner wash for cylinder #1 and #2 on Mud pump #2 plugged up, causing piston rubbers on Cyl""1 and #2 to wash out. The temperature of the mud in the pits was at that time 55 deg. Celsius. Piston Failure/wash-out - 0.5 hr Downtime for repair BECAUSE Inadequate cooling / Liner spray plugged BECAUSE Inadequate Cleaning of cooling system AND Not observed when plugging The plugging was not discovered in time to prevent washing out the pistons. TD of well is now reached. Liner spray pan and system completely cleaned out while running casing liner. All 3 mud pumps cleaned out and checked one by one.

33,"Drilling operations suspended while troubleshooting low charge pressure on #3 hex pump (pump #1 down with discharge module, pump #5 down with swab). We had been off bottom circulating with mud pump #2 and #3 while cleaning liner wash system on mud pump #4. After pump #4 back online, we went to go back drilling when mud pump #3 suction charge pressure dropped below threshold and cause pump #3 to shutdown. Picked up off bottom to clean suction strainer on mud pump #3. (Note: The strainers on all pumps had been cleaned within the last day with minimum debris found in them. We had recently started pumping HiVis weighted sweeps and thought it may have picked up something in the suction line to cause the loss of pressure). (Note: When cleaning suction strainer, the vacuum cutting box in the moonpool filled up and had to be pumped out prior to finishing suction strainer - we would usually change out cutting boxes, but the wind speed was more than the crane could operate in ~45 knots/hr) We will continue to monitor charge pressure and take appropriate actions to minimize downtime, by precautionarily checking suction strainers when operations allow. Isolated Hex #3 and cleaned suction strainer (minimum amount of lime in strainer and adjacent line had minimum build up in it). While cleaning #3 strainer, #4 liner wash was seen to be plugging up again (drain tank and blow down lines again), ongoing swab change out on hex #5 simultaneously (Replacing discharge module on Hex #1 suspended while getting pumps #3, #4, #5 back online)",5.1 - Hyd/Pnuem - Blockage/plugged ,Hydraulic_Failure,3.0,Hydraulic_Failure,3,Hydraulic_Failure,3,Hydraulic_failure,Hydraulic_failure,Hydraulic_failure,Hydraulic_failure,Hydraulic_failure,Hydraulic_failure
